Cores is a library of somewhat reusable hardware modules that I have
accumulated for different FPGA projects. Each module has one or more related
cores. Here is the module structure:

<module>/
    doc/        Documentation
    isim/       Scripts for running the Xilinx ISIM simulator
    tb/         Testbench source files for verification
    *.v         Verilog source files for synthesis
    *.vhd       VHDL source files for synthesis
