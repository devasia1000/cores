Cores is a library of somewhat reusable hardware modules that I have
accumulated for different FPGA projects. Here is the module structure:

<module>/
    doc/        Documentation
    isim/       Scripts for running Xilinx ISIM
    tb/         Testbench sources files for verification
    *.v         Verilog source files for synthesis
    *.vhd       VHDL source files for synthesis
