Cores is a library of somewhat reusable hardware modules that I have
accumulated for different FPGA projects.


Installation
============

Set the NFARRING_CORES environment variable to point to this top-level
directory. Then you can refer to individual cores and their include files in
your toolchain.


Module Structure
================

Each module has one or more related cores. Here is the module structure:

<module>/
    doc/        Documentation
    isim/       Scripts for running the Xilinx ISIM simulator
    tb/         Testbench source files for verification
    *.v         Verilog source files for synthesis
    *.vhd       VHDL source files for synthesis
